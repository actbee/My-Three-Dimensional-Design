# MY THREE DIMENSIONAL DESIGN

## About

This is an art guided project I made to express the feeling of science combined with art.
The amazing model is composed of three indepent circles. By combinning those basic circles an amazing artwork is finished.
Also this is the first 3D model I have ever made. I still keep the final entity model in my bedroom.^__^
